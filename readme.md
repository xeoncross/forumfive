## Forum Five

A lightweight PHP forum system in less than 5kB. Features email login system, DNSBL checking, rate-limiting, IP logging, moderator tools, and a nice clean interface.

This system self-installs and uses an SQLite database making backups very simple.

Requires the system to be in the root directory `/` of the site. If you already have a website then place this system in a subdomain such as (`forum.example.com`).

Download the system, edit `forum.php`, and enjoy!
